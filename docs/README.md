## ðŸŽ¤ Huddle â€” _Micro-Podcasts for Your Inner Circle_

**Overview**  
Huddle creates a space for short voice updates. Instead of long podcasts or chaotic voice notes, users share 60-second clips that build daily rhythms with friends, classes, or teams. Itâ€™s intimacy + structure in audio form.
